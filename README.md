[Fluture][] type definitions for [Sanctuary][].

> `npm install --save fluture sanctuary-def fluture-sanctuary-types`

```js
const {create, env} = require('sanctuary-def');
const {env: flutureEnv} = require('fluture-sanctuary-types');
const Future = require('fluture');

const def = create({checkTypes: true, env: env.concat(flutureEnv)});
```

## types

The package also exports the type constructors in named exports.

### `FutureType :: Type -> Type -> Type`

The binary type constructor for members of Future.

```js
const {test, String, Number} = require('sanctuary-def');
const {env, FutureType} = require('fluture-sanctuary-types');
const {of} = require('fluture');

test(env, FutureType(String, Number), of(1))
//> true
```

### `ConcurrentFutureType :: Type -> Type -> Type`

The binary type constructor for members of ConcurrentFuture.

```js
const {test, String, Number} = require('sanctuary-def');
const {env, ConcurrentFutureType} = require('fluture-sanctuary-types');
const {of, Par} = require('fluture');

test(env, ConcurrentFutureType(String, Number), Par(of(1)))
//> true
```
