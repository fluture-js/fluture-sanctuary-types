//. ```js

//.
//. const def = $.create ({checkTypes: true, env: $.env.concat (env)});

//# FutureType :: Type -> Type -> Type
//.
//. The binary type constructor for members of Future.
//.
//. ```js
//. > $.test (env) (FutureType ($.String) ($.Number)) (Future.of (1));
//. true
//. ```

//# ConcurrentFutureType :: Type -> Type -> Type
//.
//. The binary type constructor for members of ConcurrentFuture.
//.
//. ```js
//. > $.test
//. .   (env)
//. .   (ConcurrentFutureType ($.String) ($.Number))
//. .   (Future.Par.of (1));
//. true
//. ```

//# env :: Array Type
//.
//. An Array containing all types applied to [`$.Unknown`][Unknown] for
//. direct use as a Sanctuary environment, as shown in [Usage](#usage).
